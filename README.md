# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this repository are a number of versions of a Tic Tac Toe game. It was an early (December 2015) exploration of using alpha-beta pruning algorithms to create an intelligent bot to play people at Tic-Tac-Toe.

Additionally, I then extended it to include a basic GUI using TKinter, and extended that to create a 2D version of the game.

### Running the program

To run the Tic-Tac-Toe versions, you can simply run

```zsh
> python menu.py
```

This will give you the option to run any of the 3 versions included:

1. Simple command line version with an unbeatable component
2. A GUI game with an unbeatable component
3. A 2D Tic-Tac-Toe GUI game which you can play with another person (or on your own - it's harder than it looks!) _A brief introduction to the game can be found [here](http://logicprogramming.stanford.edu/examples/nineboard/index.html)_
