# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this repository are a number of versions of a Tic Tac Toe game. It was an early (December 2015) exploration of using alpha-beta pruning algorithms to create an intelligent bot to play people at Tic-Tac-Toe.

Additionally, I then extended it to include a basic GUI using TKinter.

### Command Line Version

You can play a simple command line version of the game using the `command-line-game.py` script.
